# Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced world, the demand for efficient, user-friendly car rental services is growing. Traditional rental services often involve lengthy booking processes, limited vehicle availability insights, and inadequate pricing transparency. This leads to frustration for customers, inefficiencies in vehicle utilization, and revenue losses for rental companies.

The goal of this project is to design the **Low-Level Design (LLD)** of a **Car Rental System** that addresses these challenges by creating a scalable, maintainable, and robust system architecture. The system will support key features such as:

- **Vehicle Inventory Management**: Handling different types of vehicles, availability tracking, and maintenance scheduling.
- **User Bookings**: Enabling customers to search for available vehicles, book rentals, and manage reservations.
- **Payment and Pricing**: Implementing dynamic pricing based on factors like vehicle type, rental duration, and demand.
- **User Management**: Supporting user registration, login, and profile management, along with an admin dashboard for overseeing operations.
- **Search and Filtering**: Providing easy search and filtering options for users to find suitable vehicles.

This project aims to provide the foundation for a comprehensive car rental service that enhances the user experience while ensuring operational efficiency.
